            <h2>01</h2>
            <h3>Wether</h3>
            <p>
                Weather is arguably the best weather app out there. It features a simple, 
                paginated design that shows you the current weather, forecast for up to 12 weeks, 
                a radar, and other fun stats. Along with that, you‚Äôll get a fairly decent set of lightly 
                customizable widgets and the standard stuff like severe weather notifications and a radar 
                so you can see the storms approaching. Perhaps its best feature is its minimal design which 
                just shows you the weather (and fun facts, if you want). The free version has all of the features. 
                The $1.99 charge removes advertising. Otherwise the two versions work the same way. Most will also 
                likely enjoy the range of weather fun facts the app offers as well. Other great weather apps include 
                Dark Sky, Weather Underground, and Today Weather.

            <h2>02</h2>
            <h3>Bouncer</h3>
            <p>
                Bouncer was our pick for the best maps Android app from 2018. It's a security app with a unique premise. 
                The app lets you grant temporary permissions to applications. So, for instance, you can let Facebook 
                access your location long enough to check into a place, and Bouncer disables the permission once you leave Facebook. 
                This is a great way to use all of the features of a social media app without digging into your settings to disable those 
                permissions or giving those apps permanent access to your information. The app runs for $0.99 and should work on most 
                (if not all) apps. It's rumored that this could be an Android Q feature. If that's true, then even Google really likes this app.

            <h2>03</h2>
            <h3>Google Drive Suite</h3>
            <p>
                Google Drive is a cloud storage solution available on Android where all maps users get 15GB for free permanently upon signing up.
                 You can, of course, buy more if needed. What makes Google Drive so special are the suite of Android apps that are attached to it. 
                 They include Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Photos, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Keep. Between the office 
                 apps, the Photos app (which allows unlimited photo and video backup), and Keep for note taking, you have apps for practically 
                 anything you need to do in terms of productivity. Some of the features of these apps include live collaboration, deep sharing 
                 features, and compatibility with Microsoft Office documents. Microsoft Office has a similar setup with OneDrive and Office. 
                 That makes them a great alternative for Google Drive. However, Google's solution is just easier to use.

            <h3>Google Maps and Waze </h3>
            <p>
                Google Maps virtually owns the navigation apps scene and it remains of the best Android apps ever. It gets frequent, almost weekly 
                updates that seem to only add to its incredibly generous list of existing features. Aside from the very basics, Google Maps gives you 
                access to places of interest, traffic data, directions to things like rest stops or gas stations, and they even let you have offline maps 
                now (albiet temporarily). If you add to that the Waze experience, which includes tons of its own features, and you won‚Äôt need another 
                navigation app. Ever. Google also owns and operates Waze. It's unique and fun in ways that Google Maps isn't and we also highly recommend it.

            <h3>Google Assistant </h3>
            <p>
                    This is one seriously powerful app. It also works on most Android devices. You simply download the app and then enable it. 
                    From there, you can ask it whatever you want. It also supports a variety of commands. You can control lights, ask about population control, 
                    and it can even do simple math problems for you. There are a variety of products like Google, Bose QC II Bluetooth headphones, 
                    Home and Chromecast that extent the functionality even further. There is also a second Google Assistant app for those who want a quick 
                    launch icon on the home screen. The hardware stuff costs money, but Google Assistant is free. Amazon Alexa is another excellent app in this space, 
                    but it doesn't support Google Android quite as much as we would like, yet.
